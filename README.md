# My very first codeprogram

## How old is it?
Sadly I can't tell for sure.

1. This [Button](_1_BUTTON.ino) script may be the oldest according to my memory.<br>
    I am not 100% sure tho.

2. This [series circuit](Hausaufgabe_reihenhelligkeit.ino) for an LED array however has a older last-modified-date.

    my first script must defently be older than that.

## What do I know
1. My Arduino class was always on Mondays
2. The first Monday after the school holidays was the 09.07.2015
3. I had it around 1PM
4. The code was written for Arduni Uno

## What do I believe now
I believe I had my first lesson on C++ on Monday the 7th of september. We learned how to turn an LED on and of and the script I used there is lost.<br>
We probably got some homework after that lesson. A array of LED's makes much more sense to tackle first instead of the functionality of a button.<br>
<br>
So this [series circuit](Hausaufgabe_reihenhelligkeit.ino) is probably the first code I have ever written on my own. <br>
I would determine the date of creation on Sunday the 13th of september 2015.
